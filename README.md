# Python Examples


Tutorials of several Python console programs in Visual Studio

The BusinessExample tutorial uses variables, lists, functions,
loops, dictionaries, and classes involving a restaurant, with
it's menu, franchise locations, and the actual names of the
restaurants.

The FinanceExample tutorial takes the Tesla stock and imports
many packages, uses them as aliases, and goes through a series
of exercises creating different graphs.  It also creates a
text file of Tesla stock data (open, close, high, low, etc.)
from 1/1/2009 until 12/31/2018.

The SandP500 tuturial takes all 500 companies from the S&P 500
and creates text files of each company with stock data (open,
close, high, low, etc.).  It also imports packages with aliases
as necessary to ultimately create a custom correlation graph.

To run each program, right click on the .py file and select
Set as Startup File and then run the program.  The default
program is SandP500.py.
